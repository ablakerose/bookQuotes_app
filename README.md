Project title: BookQuotes: Carrying Ideas Forward.

Welcome to BookQuotes! BookQuotes is intended to provide users with the ability to track the books they read as along with interesting and powerful quotes from those books. The program was created to provide a clean, simple interface for the user to have easy access to the stored information. 

Currently, a user can add the title and author of books to the list. They have the choice listing a quote right when adding a new book as well as continuing to add more quotes to books as needed. They can also update the title and author of the books.  

In the future, when a user saves a book, the user will have the opportunity to attach tags to each quote and filter by multiple tags. This way, a user can have easy access to quotes by a single or multiple categories. For example if a user filtered by tags "power", "optimism", or "history", the user might come across:

"To be hopeful in bad times is not just foolishly romantic. It is based on the fact that human history is a history not only of cruelty, but also of compassion, sacrifice, courage, kindness. What we choose to emphasize in this complex history will determine our lives. If we see only the worst, it destroys our capacity to do something. If we remember these times and places (and here are so many) this gives us the energy to act.” Howard Zinn, You Can’t be Neutral on a Moving Train 

Addiitonal future plans for the program could include the ability to add items with noteworthy that are not books, such as academic journals, blog posts, court decisions, speeches, etc.
